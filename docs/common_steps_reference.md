# Common Steps Quick Reference

## Overview
This is a quick reference guide for all available atomic step definitions in `CommonSteps.java`. These steps can be used across **all** feature files and pages without creating new step definitions.

## ‚úÖ Assertion Steps

### Visibility Assertions
```gherkin
Then I should see "element_name"
Then "element_name" should be visible
Then "element_name" is visible
Then I should not see "element_name"
Then "element_name" should not be visible

### Text Assertions
```gherkin
Then "element_name" should contain text "expected_text"
Then "element_name" contains "expected_text"
Then "element_name" should have text "exact_text"
Then "element_name" text is "exact_text"
Then the page should contain "text"
```

**Example:**
```gherkin
Then "Article Title" should contain text "Neutral Milk"

  Given I am on the Explorer page
  When I tap on "Search Field"
  And I enter "Mobile Testing" into "Search Field"
  And I hide the keyboard
  Then "Search Field" should contain text "Mobile Testing"
  And "Search Results" should be visible
```

### Example 3: Form Submission
```gherkin
Scenario: Submit login form
  Given I am on the Login page
  When I enter "user@test.com" into "Email Field"
  And I enter "password123" into "Password Field"
  And I tap "Login Button"
  Then I should see "Dashboard"
  And "Welcome Message" should contain text "user@test.com"
```

### Example 4: Scrolling and Interaction
```gherkin
Scenario: Accept terms and conditions
  Given I am on the Registration page
  When I scroll to "Terms Checkbox"
  And I tap "Terms Checkbox"
  And I scroll to "Submit Button"
  And I tap "Submit Button"
  Then "Confirmation Message" should be visible
```

### Example 5: Multiple Verifications
```gherkin
Scenario: Verify page elements
  Given I am on the Explorer page
  Then I should see "Wikipedia Logo"
  And "Search Field" should be visible
  And "Tabs Button" should be enabled
  And "Featured Article" is visible
  And "Today Header" should have text "Today"
```

### Example 6: Complex Flow with Waits
```gherkin
Scenario: Save article after loading

  When I wait for "Featured Article" to appear
  And I tap on "Article Image"
  And I wait for 2 seconds
  Then "Article Content" should be visible

## üé® Style Guidelines

### Element Names
- ‚úÖ **DO:** Use descriptive, business-friendly names
  - `"Search Field"`, `"Submit Button"`, `"Welcome Message"`
- ‚ùå **DON'T:** Use technical IDs or selectors
  - `"search_input_id"`, `"btn_submit"`, `"//XCUIElement"`

### Readability
- ‚úÖ **DO:** Write natural, flowing scenarios
  ```gherkin
  When I tap "Login Button"
  And I wait for "Dashboard" to appear
  Then I should see "Welcome Message"
  ```
- ‚ùå **DON'T:** Write technical, implementation-focused scenarios
  ```gherkin
  When I click element at xpath "//button[@id='login']"
  And I wait 5 seconds
  Then element with id "dashboard" is displayed
  ```

## üîß Customization

### Adding New Common Steps

If you need a new atomic step that could be reused across pages:

1. **Add to CommonSteps.java:**
```java
@When("I long press {string}")
public void iLongPress(String elementName) {
    currentPage.longPress(elementName);
}
```

2. **Implement in BasePage.java:**
```java
public void longPress(String elementName) {
    By locator = getLocatorFor(elementName);
    // Long press implementation
}
```

3. **Use in any feature file:**
```gherkin
When I long press "Menu Item"
```

## üí° Tips

1. **Combine atomic steps** for complex workflows
2. **Use explicit waits** instead of hard waits when possible
3. **Name elements consistently** across all pages
4. **Keep scenarios focused** on one feature/behavior
5. **Reuse these steps** before creating custom ones

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Review `iosExplorer.feature` for real examples
2. Check `step_definitions_strategy.md` for architecture details
3. Start writing scenarios using these atomic steps
4. Add page-specific steps only when needed
